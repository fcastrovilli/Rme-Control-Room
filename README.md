# Rme Control Room

This is a tool i built in spare time for my RME UFX.

I made 3 completely different versions but unfortunately i can't find theyr source code anymore.

The first one was ugly and unstable because of the analog potentiometer and the dirty soldering tecnique.
It was based on an Arduino Uno with a custom firmware to make it visible as HID device.

The second one was way better (i think the best tbh).
I designed the enclosure to make it easy to use as possible.
You can change the functionality of the only one encoder by clicking and pressing it in different combinations.
For you, curious people, there are some easter eggs in the code you could appriciate.

In few days I will make more photos of my actual v3 and share code with you.

Good listening session!
